# EDA-Project-on-Data-Scientists-Salary
This is an Exploratory Analysis on the Salary rate of Data Scientists at different job fields, location, experience level, employment types, etc.

Data science jobs are some of the fastest-growing, most in-demand in technology. Since 2012, Data Scientist roles have increased by 650 percent, and this rise shows no sign of stopping. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the demand for data science skills will increase another 27.9 percent by 2026. And, according to a report from McKinsey, that spells a shortage of between 140,000 and 190,000 people with analytical skills in the U.S. alone—not to mention another 1.5 million managers and analysts who will be required to understand how data analysis drives decision-making.

Data Scientist salaries have also risen with demand; Data Scientists can typically expect to make six figures. Demand also translates into an ability to relocate far more easily—from city to city, and even internationally.
